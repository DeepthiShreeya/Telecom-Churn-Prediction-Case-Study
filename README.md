## General Information
- This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn by leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling techniques.
- The objective is to identify key drivers of customer churn and to develop models that assist in proactively addressing retention challenges.
- Historical customer data—including demographics, usage patterns, and service interactions—was examined to uncover trends and insights that can drive strategic decisions in the telecom industry.

## Conclusions
- **Key Factors Leading to Churn:**
  1) Specific customer demographics and usage behaviors.
  2) Patterns in service interactions and billing issues.
  3) Frequent service complaints or disruptions.
- **Strategies to Reduce Churn:**
  1) Identifying high-risk customer segments for targeted interventions.
  2) Optimizing resource allocation to enhance customer support.
  3) Implementing proactive measures based on data-driven insights.
